Hi I'm Armando Santaniello from Italy,
I'm sound designer and elecroacoutis music performer, graduated from the conservatory of Avellino (ITALY), My work is to deal with the creation of interactive sound installations in collaboration with  Collettivo AGATA

MacroPsia is a Box of contents made with p5Js and  processing per android, that they would like to emphasize the distorted perceptions caused by  pandemic started in 2020.
   
Macropsia is a neurological condition that affects human visual perception, whereby objects appear larger than they really are,
I adopted the name of this disorder to summarize people's difficult perception of the new social and moral rules introduced by the world pandemic.
In this page i will shares diffrent codes done by myself and other codes created by different artists, which I found on the net, to which I added an   interactive sound part.

### Barriers 
Barrier is a scripting made with p5js in which a bouncing sphere produces a random pitch sound with each impact with the barriers, the interaction with the mouse or the fingers will add different processing to the sound.
