# MacroPsia

Hi I'm Armando Santaniello from Italy,
I'm sound designer and elecroacoutis music performer, graduated from the conservatory of Avellino (ITALY), My work is to deal with the creation of interactive sound installations in collaboration with  Collettivo AGATA

MacroPsia is a content box that includes scripts made with p5J and electroacoustic compositions, in which I try to summarize some characteristics related to the distorted pitch of reality caused by the pandemic.
   
Catastrophic events on an international scale, inequalities of human rights, time out for the climate, "legitimate" coercion implemented from states around the world, they are not just representative elements of a fantastic novel from the early 1900s, but all this create the context in which mankind moves its steps today.
The global pandemic was just the impetus that produced a stream of news that fueled different interpretations of reality.
Even for just a moment each individual had an uncertainty or a distorted vision of things, a large part of society seemed to be affected by Micropsia, a neurological vision disorder that makes the observed objects perceive smaller than the real ones, and it is the opposite. to Macropsia, in which the objects are larger.

In this page i will shares diffrent codes done by myself and other codes created by different artists, which I found on the net, to which I added an  interactive sound part.

### Barriers 
Barrier is a scripting made with p5js in which a bouncing sphere produces a random pitch sound at each impact with the barriers, the interaction with the mouse or the fingers will add different processing to the sound.

### Macroseq 
Macroseq it's a code Made by Fernando Guillen, it' s a generative sequencer to witch I added an interactive glitch Sound file that changehs pitch on x and y axis

### Micropsia_surrogated
The song comes from a reworked Live performance. In the various parts the same sound seed investigates and expresses itself in its microscopic and macroscopic qualities.
The composition is accompanied by an abstract video of the musical instrument taken with a digital microscope, which is revealed when its sound nature can be perceived.
